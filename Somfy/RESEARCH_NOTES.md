# Research and Investigation Notes

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: This plugin was originally based on Hunter Douglas PowerView API patterns, but Phantom Blinds use the **Somfy TaHoma** API, which is significantly different!

See [`TAHOMA_VS_POWERVIEW.md`](TAHOMA_VS_POWERVIEW.md) for detailed comparison.

## Major Findings

✅ **Official API Found**: https://github.com/Somfy-Developer/Somfy-TaHoma-Developer-Mode

### Key Facts About TaHoma API:
1. **HTTPS only** on port 8443 (not HTTP)
2. **Bearer token authentication required** (not optional)
3. **Event polling** (not SSE streaming)
4. **Different URL structure** entirely
5. **Self-signed certificates** (need CA trust)
6. **mDNS discovery** with `_kizboxdev._tcp` service

## Current Plugin Status

The existing code in `Controller.py` implements PowerView patterns:
- ❌ HTTP on port 80
- ❌ No authentication
- ❌ SSE streaming for events
- ❌ PowerView URL structure

**Action Required**: Major refactoring needed to support TaHoma API properly.

This file contains areas where more information is needed about the Somfy/Phantom Blinds API.

## High Priority Research Items

### 1. Authentication ✅ RESOLVED
- [x] Does the API require authentication? **YES**
- [x] API keys, tokens, or credentials needed? **Bearer token**
- [x] OAuth support? **No**
- [x] Basic auth? **No, Bearer token only**
- [x] Certificate-based auth? **HTTPS with self-signed cert**

**Implementation**:
- Enable Developer Mode in TaHoma app (tap version 7 times)
- Generate token from Developer Mode menu
- Add `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to all requests
- Trust CA cert from `https://ca.overkiz.com/overkiz-root-ca-2048.crt`

### 2. Gateway Discovery ✅ RESOLVED
- [x] mDNS/Bonjour service name: **`_kizboxdev._tcp`**
- [x] Default hostname pattern: **`gateway-{pin}.local`** (e.g., `gateway-2001-0001-1891.local`)
- [x] Discovery protocol: **mDNS**
- [ ] Multi-gateway coordination: **TBD**

**TXT Records**:
- `gateway_pin`: Gateway PIN (e.g., 1234-5678-9012)
- `api_version`: Version of available REST API (e.g., 1)
- `fw_version`: Firmware version (e.g., 2019.4.3)

### 3. API Versioning ✅ RESOLVED
- [x] Are there different API versions? **Yes**
- [x] Version negotiation: **Via `/apiVersion` endpoint (no auth required)**
- [ ] Backward compatibility: **TBD**
- [x] Feature detection by API version: **Via protocolVersion in response**

**Example**:
```bash
GET /enduser-mobile-web/1/enduserAPI/apiVersion
# Returns: {"protocolVersion": "2022.1.3-1"}
```

### 4. Rate Limiting ✅ RESOLVED
- [x] What are the rate limits? **NO rate limiting on local API**
- [x] Per-endpoint limits: **None**
- [x] Global request limits: **None (but gateway can be overloaded)**
- [x] Consequences of exceeding limits: **Gateway latency**
- [x] Retry-After headers: **Not applicable**

**Best Practices** (from Somfy):
- Call `/setup` at application start
- Register event listener with `/events/register`
- Fetch events on `/events/{listenerId}/fetch` **once per second maximum**
- Don't poll too frequently to avoid overloading gateway
