## Why Archived?

These documents were moved to the archive on 2025-11-11 to:

- Reduce clutter in the main documentation directory
- Preserve project history for future reference
- Avoid confusion about which system (PowerView vs TaHoma) is currently in use

The project now uses **Somfy TaHoma** exclusively. All references to
PowerView or Hunter Douglas are historical only and relate to the original
plugin development process.
