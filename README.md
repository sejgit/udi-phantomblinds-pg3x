# Phantom Blinds Device Nodeserver

## Plugin for Universal Devices Isy

The Virtual plugin is one way to take data from external sources and in turn use
these nodes of data more effectively.  The nodes become devices from which status
and control are possible in programs & as an included device in scenes.  It produces
a cleaner display in the AC and Remote tools.

With this nodeserver you can create virtual nodes which represent shades, or scenes
 of Phantom Blinds for use in user scenes and/or programs.
